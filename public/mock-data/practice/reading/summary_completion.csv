1,"Firefighters are the people who fight fires on a daily basis. They work for fire departments, which are organizations of trained professionals that keep the community safe from fires. When a fire breaks out, firefighters enter buildings to look for people and pets, rescue them, and put out the fire to prevent it from spreading. They also conduct safety drills and inspections to keep businesses and agencies safe. Firefighters must have a variety of skills and knowledge. They must be physically fit and must be able to work in harsh conditions and difficult situations. In addition to responding to fires, firefighters often help in situations that require medical attention, such as automobile accidents and gas emergencies. In addition to physical skills and knowledge, firefighters have to have strong social skills, because they must often interact with people during stressful situations.","[""Firefighters are the people who fight fires on a "", {""id"": 1}, "" daily basis.
