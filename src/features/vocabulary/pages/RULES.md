# RULES

This directory (`src/features/vocabulary/pages`) contains the **Vocabulary Practice** activities for the application.

**CRITICAL RULE: DO NOT CONFUSE WITH MAIN PRACTICE.**

- Vocabulary practice activities have specific mechanics, like displaying English translations for options upon submission.
- Main practice activities are located in `src/features/practice/pages/` and should **not** have these vocabulary-specific mechanics applied to them.
